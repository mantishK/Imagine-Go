# Imagine-Go
The Go Anthem

Imagine there's no Generics  
It's easy if you try  
No Classes worry us  
Compile on the fly  
Imagine all the people  
Using Go today...  
  
Imagine Lang not verbose  
It isn't hard to do  
Nothing to malloc or free for  
And no threads too  
Imagine all the developers  
Living life in peace...  
  
You may say I'm a dreamer  
But there's a Lang with all the fun  
I hope someday you'll join us  
And coding will agian be fun  
  
Imagine no pointer arithmetic  
I wonder if you can  
No need for extend or implement  
Channels are like flan  
Imagine all the people  
Sharing Go on Github...  
  
You may say I'm a dreamer  
But there's a Lang with all the fun  
I hope someday you'll join us  
And coding will agian be fun
